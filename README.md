# 🌊 Kayaking Club "River Pulse"

**River Pulse** is a web project for a small kayaking club based in Canada.  
The website combines two main functionalities:  
- **Tour booking system** for available kayaking routes.  
- **Community blog** for members to share and discuss updates.

The goal of the project is to unite people who are passionate about kayaking, outdoor activities, and nature exploration.  
It serves both as an informative platform and a community hub for adventure lovers.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The website includes the following main pages:
- **About** — information about the club, mission, and activities.  
- **Routes & Prices** — a list of tours available for booking.  
- **Our Blog** — latest club news and articles with commenting functionality.  
- **User Account** — displays booked tours and allows users to edit their account details.  
- **Admin Page** — available only for administrators to manage tours and blog posts.

User authentication is implemented with **role-based access** (Admin / User).

The website design was inspired by the  
[**Ireland Tours Travel Website Concept**](https://www.behance.net/gallery/79401133/Ireland-Tours-Travel-Website-Concept),  
but reworked and customized to fit the kayaking club’s theme and needs.
